## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "react-leaflet": "^5.0.0",
  "leaflet": "^1.9.4", 
  "d3": "^7.8.5",
  "idb-keyval": "^6.2.1",
  "topojson-client": "^3.1.0",
  "@types/d3": "^7.4.3",
  "@types/topojson-client": "^3.1.0"
}
```

### Core Files Created
- `components/LeafletMap.tsx` - Main map component (811 lines)
- `hooks/usePopulationData.ts` - Census API integration with caching
- `hooks/useOfficialsData.ts` - Officials API with fallbacks  
- `styles/leaflet-map.css` - Glass morphism styling and responsive design

### Data Sources Integrated
- **US Atlas TopoJSON**: States and counties geometry
- **Census ACS 2023**: Population and land area data
- **Google Civic API**: Officials information
- **OpenStates API**: State legislators fallback
- **5Calls API**: Federal representatives fallback

### Features Implemented
- State centroids for all 50 states
- County counts by state (254 for Texas, 58 for California, etc.)
- Representatives count (House + Senate) by state
- Population density calculations and color mapping
- Smart caching with 1-week duration for Census data
- 24-hour cache for officials data
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

## üßπ Cleanup Completed

### Files Removed
- `components/leaflet-map.tsx` (old implementation)
- `components/modern-us-map.tsx` (unused component)
- `components/map-v2/` (entire directory with 6 files)
- `styles/map-v2.css` (old styling)

### Files Updated
- `components/home-page.tsx` - Fixed import path to new LeafletMap
- `components/Map.tsx` - Updated to use new LeafletMap
- `components/location-setup.tsx` - Already using correct LeafletMap
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed old CSS import

### Integration Points
- All existing components now use the new `LeafletMap` component
- Proper dynamic imports to prevent SSR issues
- Consistent prop interfaces across all usage points

## üß™ Testing Status

### Test Page
- Created `app/test-leaflet/page.tsx` for comprehensive testing
- Accessible at `/test-leaflet` route
- Tests both default and dashboard modes
- Demonstrates all features and data integration

### Production Readiness
- ‚úÖ Server running successfully on localhost:3000
- ‚úÖ Map loads with Census data integration
- ‚úÖ State/county drill-down working
- ‚úÖ Officials data loading with fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Glass morphism UI rendering correctly
- ‚úÖ Responsive design and accessibility features active

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

- **SWR caching** for efficient data fetching
- **IndexedDB storage** for persistent client-side caching
- **Dynamic imports** to prevent SSR issues
- **Debounced events** for smooth interactions
- **Memoized calculations** for color scales and data processing
- **Optimized re-renders** with proper React hooks usage

## üì± Accessibility & UX

- **ARIA live regions** for screen reader support
- **Keyboard navigation** with +, -, R shortcuts
- **Focus management** with proper tab order
- **High contrast mode** support
- **Reduced motion** preferences respected
- **Mobile-responsive** design with touch support

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The new Leaflet-based map implementation is now:
- ‚úÖ Fully functional and tested
- ‚úÖ Integrated across all relevant pages
- ‚úÖ Meeting all specified requirements
- ‚úÖ Optimized for performance and accessibility
- ‚úÖ Ready for production deployment

All old map components have been cleaned up and the codebase is now using the single, comprehensive `LeafletMap` component throughout the application.
