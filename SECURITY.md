# Security & Privacy Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security and privacy measures implemented in the Citizen Engagement App to protect user data and ensure secure operation.

## Security Headers

The application implements comprehensive security headers via Next.js configuration:

- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin** - Controls referrer information
- **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS filtering
- **Permissions-Policy** - Restricts access to sensitive APIs (camera, microphone, geolocation)

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- All data transmission uses HTTPS/TLS encryption
- Supabase provides encryption at rest for stored data
- Environment variables are never exposed to the client

### Data Minimization
- Only essential data is collected (email, location for functionality)
- No tracking cookies or unnecessary analytics
- Location data is used only for finding representatives

### Access Control
- Authentication handled by Supabase with industry-standard security
- Service role keys are server-side only
- Client-side API keys have restricted permissions

## API Security

### Census API
- Uses official US Census Bureau API
- No API key required (public data)
- No personal data transmitted

### Google Maps API (Optional)
- Used only for address validation when configured
- API key restricted to specific domains
- No personal data stored by Google for our application

### Supabase
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Service role key used only server-side
- Authentication tokens are secure and auto-refreshing

## Environment Variables

### Required for Full Functionality
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### Optional
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_maps_key
```

### Security Notes
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- Use different keys for development/production
- Regularly rotate service role keys
- Restrict API key permissions to minimum required

## Code Security

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Address validation through trusted APIs
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- No unused packages in production
- Security-focused package selection

### Error Handling
- No sensitive information in error messages
- Graceful degradation for API failures
- User-friendly error reporting

## Privacy Compliance

### Data Collection
- **Location**: Used only for finding representatives
- **Email**: For account management and notifications
- **Usage**: Anonymous analytics only

### User Rights
- **Access**: Users can request their data
- **Correction**: Users can update their information
- **Deletion**: Complete account and data removal
- **Portability**: Data export in standard formats

### Third-Party Services
- **US Census API**: No personal data shared
- **Google Maps**: Address validation only, not stored
- **Supabase**: Secure authentication and data storage
