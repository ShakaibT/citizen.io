# Citizen Engagement App - Backup & Recovery Strategy

## 1. Git-Based Backups

### Current Status
- ✅ Main branch is clean and up to date
- ✅ Remote repository exists on GitHub/GitLab

### Recommended Actions
- Create tagged releases for stable versions
- Implement branch protection rules
- Set up automatic backups of the repository

## 2. Automated Backup Script

### Daily Backup Script
- Backs up entire project directory
- Creates timestamped archives
- Stores multiple versions
- Includes database exports if applicable

### Weekly Full System Backup
- Complete project snapshot
- Environment configuration backup
- Dependencies backup (node_modules excluded but package.json/pnpm-lock.yaml included)

## 3. Environment Protection

### Development Environment
- Use separate development branches
- Never work directly on main branch
- Test all changes in development first

### Production Environment
- Implement staging environment
- Use CI/CD pipelines for deployments
- Automatic rollback capabilities

## 4. File-Level Protection

### Critical Files to Monitor
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- All component files in `/components`
- All API routes in `/app/api`
- Environment files (`.env.local`)

### File Integrity Checks
- Regular checksums of critical files
- Automated detection of unauthorized changes
- Immediate alerts for modifications

## 5. Recovery Procedures

### Quick Recovery (Git-based)
1. `git stash` - Save current work
2. `git checkout main` - Switch to stable branch
3. `git pull origin main` - Get latest stable version
4. `rm -rf .next` - Clear build cache
5. `npm install` - Reinstall dependencies
6. `npm run dev` - Restart development

### Full Recovery (Backup-based)
1. Stop all running processes
2. Restore from latest backup
3. Verify file integrity
4. Restart services

## 6. Monitoring & Alerts

### File Change Monitoring
- Watch for unexpected file modifications
- Alert on critical file changes
- Log all file system events

### Performance Monitoring
- Track build times
- Monitor for compilation errors
- Alert on performance degradation

## 7. Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set up automated daily backups
- [ ] Create backup verification script
- [ ] Implement file integrity monitoring
- [ ] Set up branch protection rules
- [ ] Create recovery testing procedure
- [ ] Document emergency contacts
- [ ] Test backup restoration process

## 8. Emergency Contacts & Procedures

### In Case of Corruption
1. **STOP** - Don't make any changes
2. Document what happened
3. Check Git history: `git log --oneline -10`
4. Restore from last known good state
5. Investigate root cause

### Contact Information
- Primary Developer: [Your contact info]
- Backup Developer: [Backup contact]
- System Administrator: [Admin contact]

## 9. Best Practices

### Before Making Changes
1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make small, incremental commits
3. Test thoroughly before merging
4. Use pull requests for code review

### Regular Maintenance
- Weekly backup verification
- Monthly recovery testing
- Quarterly security review
- Annual backup strategy review
